### Example Code Snippets

```typescript
// DPAPayment Type definition
enum DPAPaymentType {
  Fixed = 'fixed',
  Loan = 'loan',
  IO = 'I/O'
}

type DPAParams = {
  name: string;
  type: DPAPaymentType;
  value: number;
  paymentDetails?: { // Optional details for specific types of payments
    fixedAmount?: number; // For Fixed Payment
    loanAmount?: number; // For Loan Payment
    interestRate?: number; // For I/O Payment
  }
};

// DownPaymentAssistance Class
class DownPaymentAssistance {
  name: string;
  type: DPAPaymentType;
  value: number;
  paymentDetails: { // Optional details for specific types of payments
    fixedAmount?: number; // For Fixed Payment
    loanAmount?: number; // For Loan Payment
    interestRate?: number; // For I/O Payment
  }

  constructor(name: string, type: DPAPaymentType, value: number, paymentDetails?: DPAParams['paymentDetails']) {
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
    this.value = value;
    this.paymentDetails = paymentDetails || {};
  }
}

// Functions

function calculateTotalDPA(dpa: DownPaymentAssistance, salesPrice: number, loanAmount: number): number {
  switch (dpa.type) {
    case DPAPaymentType.Fixed:
      return dpa.value + salesPrice - loanAmount;
    case DPAPaymentType.Loan:
      return (salesPrice * dpa.value / 100) + salesPrice - loanAmount;
    case DPAPaymentType.IO:
      return (loanAmount * dpa.paymentDetails.interestRate! / 12);
    default:
      throw new Error('Unknown payment type');
  }
}

function calculateDPAPayment(dpa: DownPaymentAssistance, salesPrice: number, loanAmount: number): number {
  switch (dpa.type) {
    case DPAPaymentType.Fixed:
      return dpa.value;
    case DPAPaymentType.Loan:
      return (salesPrice * dpa.value / 100);
    case DPAPaymentType.IO:
      return (loanAmount * dpa.paymentDetails.interestRate! / 12);
    default:
      throw new Error('Unknown payment type');
  }
}

function qualifierDPAPayment(dpa: DownPaymentAssistance, salesPrice: number, loanAmount: number): number {
  switch (dpa.type) {
    case DPAPaymentType.IO:
      return (loanAmount * dpa.paymentDetails.interestRate! / 12);
    default:
      throw new Error('Unsupported payment type for monthly qualifier');
  }
}
```

This code provides the definitions and implementations of key components and functions necessary to calculate down payment assistance amounts based on different criteria.
